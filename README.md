Homework 2 

Remember to add the AI statement for the assignment(5 points). 

 

Part One: Group work (150 points) 

Read the Case study statement United Aline Delays and the data. Perform exploratory data analysis and address the issues mentioned in the statement. 

Submission guidelines: 

Form a group with 3-4 members. 

Every group member submits the same executive summary report appendix by detailed (EDA) analysis, Python code and/or excel files or other related files, peer evaluation form and a 10mins recorded presentation. 

Please use Mini-Lecture Writing Executive Summaries of Data Analysis Projects.pdf as a reference to write an executive summary report. 

Part Two: individual work (45 points)  

 (Use Python) 

Question 1 

Look at the gpa data. 

What type of variable is the “gender” variable? (Categorical or Numerical?)  

For the “gender” variable, use the graphical EDA methods to visualize it. More  

importantly, please interpret all the visualizations in detail.  

What type of variable is the “studyweek” variable? (Categorical or Numerical?)  

Generate a non-graphical EDA (descriptive summary statistics) for the “studyweek” variable.  

More importantly, please interpret the results in detail.  

What type of variable is the “gpa” variable? (Categorical or Numerical?)  

Generate a non-graphical EDA (descriptive statistics) for the “gpa” variable. More  

importantly, please interpret the results in detail.  

Generate all graphical EDA methods to visualize the “gpa” variable. More  

importantly, please interpret the results in detail.  

Assess the relationship between “gpa” and “studyweek” variables by generating all non-graphical and graphical EDA methods that you learned. Are these variables strongly or weakly correlated/related? Is the correlation positive or negative? Please interpret all your findings in detail.  

Assess the relationship between the “gender” and “gpa” variables by generating all non-graphical and graphical EDA methods that you learned. Do you think variation in gpa can be explained by the gender of the student for this data set? Do you think these two variables are strongly or weakly related? Please explain.  

 

Question 2 

2. According to Burton G. Malkiel, the daily changes in the closing price of stock follow a random walk—that is, these daily events are independent of each other and move upward or downward in a random manner— and can be approximated by a normal distribution. To test this theory, use yahoo finance to select one traded company that you are interested in and do the following (google search: yahoo finance, search AAPL for example in the yahoo finance, 

 click on historical data, select 6 weeks’ time period, then download data): 

(a) Record the daily adjusted closing stock price of this company for six consecutive weeks (so that you have 30 values). For example, they are noted as X1, X2, …, X30. 

(b) Record the returns(percentage changes) in the adjusted closing stock price of this company for six consecutive weeks (so that you have 29 values). (X2 - X1)/X1, (X3-X2)/X2,…, (X30-X29)/X29. 

For these two data sets(stock price and stock return), decide whether they are approximately normally distributed by 

1). constructing the histogram and box plot. 

2). comparing data characteristics to theoretical properties of normal distribution.  

3). What can you say about your stock with respect to daily closing prices and daily changes in closing prices(returns)? Which, if any, of the data sets are approximately normally distributed?
